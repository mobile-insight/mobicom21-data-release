# Experience: A Five-Year Retrospective of MobileInsight

## Dataset

**NOTE:** Due to GitHub's file size constraint, we have migrated the raw dataset to http://mobileinsight.net/mobicom21.html

Since 2016, we have sporadically collected 4G/4.5G LTE over-the-air messages with the evolving MobileInsight and accumulated a five-year dataset. We ran MobileInsight over the test phones when using ping (primary), iperf, web, video streaming, or virtual reality applications in static, walking and driving scenarios. The following figure shows the accumulated dataset size every quarter and as of August 15, 2020. It has been collected from 50+ phone models and 58 global operators over 20+ countries and regions including the USA, China, India, South Korea, Singapore, France, Spain, Germany, Norway, Hungary, Egypt, Australia, New Zealand etc. Most data (82%) is collected in the US (AT\&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, Google Fi), covering 39 states and 260,000+ miles.

Due to the space limit by Github, this repository only includes a compressed metadata of all messages from our dataset. For the complete raw dataset, please contact support@mobileinsight.net for full access.

**How to analyze the dataset:** Analyzing these datasets requires MobileInsight. The following tutorials detail how to extract the signaling messages, configurations, and channel conditions in LTE mobility management in this paper:
